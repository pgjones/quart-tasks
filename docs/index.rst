Quart-Tasks
===========

Quart-Tasks is a `Quart <https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart>`_ extension
that provides scheduled background
tasks. Using Quart-DB you can,

 * run scheduled tasks based on a cron format,
 * run periodic tasks,
 * on top of everything Quart can do.

Quart-Tasks uses `croniter <https://github.com/kiorky/croniter>`_ to
parse the cron format.

If you are,

 * new to Quart-Tasks then try the :ref:`quickstart`,
 * new to Quart then try the `Quart documentation
   <https://pgjones.gitlab.io/quart/>`_,
